# Simscape-Power-Electronics
Power Electronics projects done using Simscape Tool Box in MATLAB-Simulink based simulation.

This projects covered basic power electronic circuits which includes DC-DC converters, Rectifiers and Inverters. Steady state analysis of these converters, with emphasis on proper selection of devices and magnetic components is intensively done. Mathematical modeling of converter transfer function using various approaches is also included for controller design of these converters. Experiments are designed to understand the working of these power electronic circuits supported with MATLAB/SIMULINK based simulation platform.
