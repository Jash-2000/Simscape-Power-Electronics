## Assumptions for CCM and DCM 

Comparing K_crticial = 1-D and K = 2L/RTs, we arrive at the following assumed values of L:

 1. CCM - K>K_crticial, hence, L = 900uH
 2.  DCM - k<k_crticial, hence, L = 400uH

* Pulse Generator had amplitude = 1, Period = 50e-6 and Width = 50%
* Source Voltage = 25V
* Output Voltages observed
    1. For DCM - 14.26V
    2. For CCM - 12.09V
